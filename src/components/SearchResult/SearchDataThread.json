Customer's initial contract was 120 TiB , they purchase three upgrades since , 10 ,15 ,and 10 TB to bring them to 155 . They contract expires in Feb . They would like another expansion of 54 . If I amend their contract for extension and expansion , we charge them the full contract amount for 18 months . and then they get a credit for 120 (the initial purchase) for the time remaining in the contract . (6 months) shouldn't they get a credit for the current contract instead , i .e . 155 ",

In your scenario , yes , I think we should be giving them a credit for the balance of payments that will occur against the original contract (i .e . , against the 155 TiB) .' ",
